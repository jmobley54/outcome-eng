== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WPFront Notification Bar and GDPR compliance? =

This plugin doesn’t collect any personal information. For more information please visit [GDPR compliance](https://wpfront.com/wpfront-and-gdpr-compliance/).

= I don’t want the plugin to be displayed on “wp-admin”, what should I do? =

Notification bar doesn’t display on the wp-admin pages, except on the notification bar settings page. On the settings page it acts as a preview so that you can see the changes you make.

= How do I stop the bar from displaying for logged in users? =

The new version(1.3) allows you to filter the bar based on user roles. In this case you need to select the “Guest users” option.
