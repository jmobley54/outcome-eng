> “The best plugin of its kind” - by celito

> “This plugin makes creating buttons sooooo easy.” - by ncrocker202

> Why aren’t all plugins like this?!?
MaxButtons easily solved my problem with lots of options when creating the button and a live view of what it was going to look like. It would have done the job for me there and then but being able to adjust the text AND link with shortcodes on my page made modifications a breeze. - by discgosforth

> “Easy, clear, and robust. I'm a programmer and can write CSS till the cows come home, but why? Just get it, install it and use it. Then, when you're impressed, buy the pro version” - by jleahy

= Free Icons =

You can use free icons when you create your buttons with MaxButtons Pro so we’ve built one of the largest libraries to inspire you and make your buttons really stand out.

= Button Shortcode =

1. Click the MaxButtons page from the admin menu.
1. Click the Add New button.
1. Create and customize your button using the button editor.
1. Fill out and select the options needed to build your button.
1. Once you're ready, click Save.
1. A [button shortcode](http://maxbuttons.com/button-shortcode/?utm_source=reposhort&utm_medium=mbrepo&utm_content=reposhort&utm_campaign=reposhort) will be generated (ex: [maxbutton id="17"] or [maxbutton name="My Button Name"]).
1. Use the shortcode anywhere in your content and the button will appear.

You can also pass the button text and URL as parameters in the [button shortcode](http://maxbuttons.com/button-shortcode/?utm_source=reposhort2&utm_medium=mbrepo&utm_content=reposhort2&utm_campaign=reposhort2), giving you even greater flexibility. For example, if you want to create a set of buttons that look exactly the same, except for the text and URL, you could do something like this:

[maxbutton id="17" text="Search Google" url="http://google.com"]

[maxbutton name="MaxButtons Button Name" text="Search Yahoo" url="http://yahoo.com"]

Another parameter you can give the shortcode is window, which tells the button whether or not to open the URL in a new window (by default the button opens the URL in the current window). To do so you always give the window parameter the value "new", shown below. Anything else will open the button URL in the current window.

[maxbutton id="17" window="new"]

You can also use the nofollow parameter, which will add a rel="nofollow" attribute to the button when set to true, as shown below (the default is false):

[maxbutton id="17" nofollow="true"]

NOTE: Passing parameters to the shortcode overrides those settings saved as part of the button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to copy a button if I want to have a different text or link? =

No. The shortcode enables you to change various items on the button including the text and link. It's better to create a single button and reuse it.

To change text and link :
[maxbutton id="1" text="yourtext" url="http://yoururl"]

If you only want to change one of the two, just leave the not needed option out.

Most often used options:

[maxbutton id="1" text="yourtext" url="http://yoururl" window="new" nofollow="true"]

You should *never* copy buttons if you only have a different line of text and / or link on any button. You can use the 'add button' dialog from your posts and pages to easily use this options

= How do I use the shortcode in a sidebar/widget? =

Simply add the button shortcode to your widget (ex: [maxbutton id="17"] or [maxbutton name="MaxButtons Button Name"]). If the styling is missing on the widget,  try to check the 'use important' checkbox under 'advanced' settings.

= How can I add the shortcode to my post/page template? =

Simply add this code snippet to any of your theme template files:
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton id="17"]'); ?>`

= Can't see styling on the frontpage =

Sometimes the button styling doesn't load on the frontpage. There are usually two major reasons:

* Theme doesn't have proper footer, check if wp_footer() is called in the theme
* Using MaxButtons with sliders, dynamic page loaders (such a parallax and one-page themes ) or caching mechanisms.
other
First ensure you have cleared all your caches. Then you can try to add the following to your shortcode: [maxbutton id=1 style="inline"]  ( replace the ID with the number of your button ).


= TablePress and MaxButtons =

TablePress uses a caching mechanism which prevents the MaxButtons style design from functioning. To solve this problem, simply add the caching option to the shortcode like this:  `[table id=123 cache_table_output=false]`  . See this [support topic on TablePress](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/maxbuttons-css-stopped-working-in-tablepress?replies=6).

A solution which will keep the cache enabled is to use this in your shortcode: [maxbutton id=1 style="inline"] . Flush the TablePress cache after adding this.

= Part of my button is cutoff, how do I fix that? =

Try enabling the container and setting its margin options. You could also fix this manually by surrounding your button shortcode with a div element with margins. For example:

`<div style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;">
    <?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton id="17"]'); ?>
    <?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton name="MaxButtons Button Name"]'); ?>
</div>`

Then adjust the margin values as needed (the order is: top, right, bottom, left).

= How do I center the button on a page? =

Enable the "Wrap with Center Div" option in the Container settings.

= How do I align multiple buttons next to each other? =

Enable the container option and set the alignment property to either "display: inline-block" or "float: left". You might also want to add some margin values to put some spacing between your buttons. If that doesn't work, try using a simple HTML table:

`<table>
    <tr>
        <td>[maxbutton id="1"]</td>
        <td>[maxbutton id="2"]</td>
        <td>[maxbutton id="3"]</td>
    </tr>
</table>`

= How do I display a MaxButton in a WordPress menu? =

By default WordPress can't display shortcodes in a menu. You can use this [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-in-menus/) to allow shortcodes in a menu. Just copy the MaxButton shortcode in the menu after installing

= How do I display a MaxButton in a slider? =

This depends on the slider plugin you are using. Most of the well-known ones are allowing the use of shortcodes within the slides. To find out if your plugin can handle that, please ask the slider vendor.

= I use Autoptimize with MaxButtons =

If you use Autoptimize plugin and see weird result, try to load the pageby adding ?ao_noptimize=1 to the URL. If the buttons load normally then the issue is with Autoptimize. You can enter an exclusion for .maxbutton in the CSS exclusions.

= Non-Latin language users =

The plugin works with users of non-lating languages with a few exceptions. First, the character set of the Database Table should be in UTF-8. If you see '????' characters in the plugin, go to Settings -> Advanced. There is a button to set the tabel to UTF-8

Secondly, please use latin only characters for button name ( Basic settings) and extra classes ( Advanced settings ). Not doing so might prevent the styling output from working correctly.
